Expansion of Sadjuuk's mod, credits to mile for updating it

This DOES NOT require the main mod but I recommend you get it anyway.
(You can find it [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030264080] Here [/url]  )

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678847247] Graphics Settings really recommended, not just for this but in general. [/url]

 Sorry for bad icon qualities or any mistakes i've made!

They require the carpet research.

Plans (If I can figure out how to do them):
 - Make the flags like art from ideology so they buff rituals
 - Make a settings to enable / disable certain flags
